To ensure smooth operations, you developed a program that manages customer orders and inventory.\n","\n","You did so without using flow control. Let's go a step further and improve this code.\n","\n","Follow the steps below to complete the exercise:\n","\n","1. Look at your code from the lab data structures, and improve repeated code with loops.\n","\n","2. Instead of asking the user to input the name of three products that a customer wants to order, do the following:\n","    \n","    a. Prompt the user to enter the name of a product that a customer wants to order.\n","    \n","    b. Add the product name to the \"customer_orders\" set.\n","    \n","    c. Ask the user if they want to add another product (yes/no).\n","    \n","    d. Continue the loop until the user does not want to add another product.\n","\n","3. Instead of updating the inventory by subtracting 1 from the quantity of each product, only do it for  the products that were ordered (those in \"customer_orders\")."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Create a list\n","products = [\"tshirt\", \"mug\", \"hat\", \"book\", \"keychain\"]\n","\n","# Create a dictionary\n","inventory = {}\n","\n","# Add user input to dictionary\n","for product in products:\n","    quantity = int(input(f\"Enter the quantity of {product}: \"))\n","    inventory[product] = quantity\n","\n","# Create a set for customer_orders\n","customer_orders = set()\n","\n","# Prompt the user to enter the name of a product that a customer wants to order\n","purchased = input(\"Please enter the name of a product you would like to buy: \")\n","if purchased in products:\n","  customer_orders.add(purchased)  # Add the product to customer_orders set\n","\n","# Ask the user if they want to buy another product - continue until they say no\n","answer = input(\"Would you like to buy another product?
